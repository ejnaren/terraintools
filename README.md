# TERRAIN TOOLS

## The what...
These components help create large mesh terrain formations in Rhinoceros easily be using curves and Grasshopper.  
This toolbox consists of several components to help create, edit and export these formations in and from Rhino. The components can be changed to get different results as shown in the introduction section.

## The why...
Traditionally several workflows are used to create terrain in different applications. But many of these has undesired side effects. In example extruding contour curves results in stepped terrain. Triangulation based on points are impossible to work with for smooth terrains, paths and roads. Subdivision surfaces have limited control of the detailing of the terrain.

These terrain tools solve this by using easily editable curves and by ellting the user define the degree of detailing.
Apart from that there are several utilities to help analyze the terrain on the way.

## The how...
Impatient eh? Alright, why dont you go though the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ejnaren/terraintools/wiki) guide and find out...

### Installation:
All the terrain tools are independant Grasshopper components. They are easily used by copying them from the TerrainTools.gh file. If you want to have them in the toolshelf of Grasshopper you can copy them into the User Object folder like any other comonent.

### Contribution:
These tools are regular clusters made of regualar GH components and there is nothing stopping anyone from opening them up and looking inside or change them. This is deliberately to help share the thinking behind the tools and to encourage sharing. Its considered polite curtesy to share comments and any improvements made to these tools in the spirit of Open Source software. Thank you.

## Roadmap and plans for the future:
I have plans to support these tools and try to fix any bugs reported and to further optimize and streamline them if I find ways to do so.  
There are not planned any new features right now as they support all the use cases in my workflows.  
That being said if anybody finds ways to improve the tools or have ideas for new ones I am happy to listen to them although my time is limited and I cant guarantee to find time to solve everything.

## Thanks
I created these tools to help solve annoying problems in my workflows and by releasing them I hope they can be of help to others as well. Thank you to the McNeel team who make these amazing tools a possibility.
